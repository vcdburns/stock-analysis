# stock-analysis
## Purpose
#### The purpose of the this analysis is to understand the importance of the level of coding that goes into analyzing data.  It is important to understand that finding the coding that solves the problem isn't enough.  It is more advantageous to understand how to code for solutions that allows for efficiency instead of just effectiveness.
## Results
#### The original script went through the array for the tickers and displayed the information by going through each individual and displaying them one at the time.  The refactored coding assigned the values within the array first, and then running through the array and displaying the information stored in each variable in the array for the needed information.  
## Summary
### Advantages vs Disadvantages
#### The advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code all depend on the problems that you are trying to solve and the amount of information that you are dealing with.  In situations where you are dealing with large amounts of information it is better to refactor your code after you figure out the problem to allow the system to calculate the problem with less effort.  It is also beneficial to refactor the code in these situations so that it is easier for you as well as others to go through the code without getting lost in unnecessary lines of codes and loops that ultimately make understanding the code and its logic unnecessarily difficult. 
#### Conversely, it is ok to use simpler code and loops to analyze less information.  In situations like this it is easier all the way around to use unrefactored code to analyze data because it is easier to follow.
### Original vs. Refactored
#### To build on the previous statements, it is easier to understand the original code because the there are ultimately fewer moving parts. As opposed to righting more complex code that isn't needed depending on the amount of data that has to be used.  
#### On the other hand, it is more efficient for use refactored code to free up processing space as well as making it easier to understand code for larger data sets that are being used.
